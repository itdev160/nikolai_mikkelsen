                <div class="title">DESCRIPTION OF APPLICATION</div>

                <p>
                    The project is the development of a calculator that provides a user with settings required for CNC
                    milling of a variety of materials. Currently the application only provides data for 2D milling where the bit is always
                    engaged with material on both edges. This will be expanded on in future development.

                    <br /><br />The calculator uses a script that loads a modal via <strong>startButton</strong> click. 
                    From there the user is asked to select from an array materials. Once the materials has been selected
                    by the user a <strong>selectMaterial.addEventListener</strong> triggers the <strong>
                    thickness.style.visibility = "visible"</strong>. Once the user enters a thickness of the material to be
                    calculated the <strong>rpm.style.visibility = "visible"</strong> is triggered and the user is prompted to 
                    enter the RPM (rotations per minute). The range is between 5000 and 60000. If user enters anything below or above they will 
                    receive a <strong>window.alert</strong> prompting them to enter a value between this. Same applies for the material thickness
                    if the user enters anything above 50mm.

                    <br /><br /> Once the parameters have been entered by the user a <strong>bitsButton.onclick</strong> fires a function that closes
                    the current modal and opens another. The application then stores the values entered in to an array and displays this to the user. 
                    A <strong>const Material</strong> is then created as well as <strong>bits</strong> which is then filtered by <strong>bits.plastic</strong>, 
                    <strong>bits.metal</strong>, and <strong>bits.multipurpose</strong> comparing them to the <strong>material</strong> array comparing the boolean
                    for true for these values. The filter also checks that the user input <strong>thicknessValue</strong> is less than the <strong>bits.cel</strong>.
                    This then populates the select options to display for the user to select from and the 

                    <br /><br /> When the user has chosen a bit the <strong>selectBitButton.onclick</strong> function closes the current modal and opens the next one.
                    The function also creates the <strong>const selectedBit</strong> finds the bit parameters and stores this as the <strong>var bitValue</strong>.
                    This is then used to run a series of if statements that first confirm that the <strong>(selectedBit.rpm >= rpmValue)</strong> or else defaults to 
                    <strong>{ rpmBit = selectedBit.rpm }</strong>. 

                    <br /><br />The boolean <strong>material.soft</strong> and <strong>material.hard</strong> are then checked and the correct chip load value is 
                    then applied. This value is then stored as <strong>var hardness</strong> which is then used to calculate <strong>var feedRate</strong> via
                    <strong>feedRate = (selectedBit.flutes * rpmBit * hardness)</strong>. From there the <strong> var numPass</strong> is calculated by
                    <strong>(Math.ceil(thicknessValue / (selectedBit.ced / selectedBit.flutes)))</strong>. And then numPass is used to calculate the 
                    <strong>passDepth</strong> if the <strong>(selectedBit.ced <= thicknessValue)</strong> by 
                    <strong>(Math.round(((thicknessValue / numPass) + Number.EPSILON) * 100) / 100)</strong>. Otherwise in the case where the selectedBit.ced is greater
                    than the thickness value then a default of <strong> passDepth = thicknessValue</strong> is applied. These values are then all displayed to the user along
                    with a few other parameter such as the angle of cut, the number of flutes, etc.

                    <br /><br />The user can exit the modal at any time by a closing it via the <strong>X</strong> or clicking outside the modal.
                    This also resets the data stored in the application by trigger the <strong>refreshPage</strong> function. 
                </p>

                    <div class="title">FUTURE DEVELOPMENT</div>
                <p>
                    Continuing with this application in ITDEV-161 will be the development of filtering product by manufacture, manufacture tooling options, which
                    in turn will filter by types of insert tools available (bits, blades, punches, plotting pens, crease tools, etc). A series of recommended parameters
                    for cutting will then be presented. In addition the materials available will be greatly expanded on by having categories/types of materials
                    which then have available materials displayed. 

                    <br /><br />In addition the goal is for users to be able to enter their own materials and parameters to submit back to the application and stored by account.
                    These can then be accessed by the individual user in the future and upon review by admin (developer) could be added to the general materials database. Which
                    is the method I would like to move towards in the future which would probably entail converting quite a bit of this to php or at minimum using php to populate
                    the JavaScript arrays.
