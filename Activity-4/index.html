            <h3>A FRESH TAKE ON PET FOOD</h3>

            We believe our dogs and cats deserve real fresh food to help them live their best, happiest, tail-wagging
            lives.
            So we developed a totally different ideology on how to feed our four legged family members.
            It’s really simple: use fresh, whole ingredients, gently cooked without preservatives, and kept in the
            fridge where meats belong.
            <br /><br />What is Freshpet? It’s the future of pet food.
            <br /><br />Our recipes are made with US-raised chicken or beef delivered daily to our Freshpet Kitchens. We
            then use steam-cooking to lock in vital nutrients, all done according to FDA and USDA standards.

                People are at the center of everything we do. WWF works to help local communities conserve the natural
                resources they depend upon, transform markets and policies toward sustainability,
                and protect and restore species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is
                reflected in decision-making from a local to a global scale.<br />

                Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but it’s also people who have the
                power to change this trajectory. Together, we can address the greatest threats to
                life on this planet and protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.
